# Module 6- World_Weather_Analysis
**#Purpose**

    The purpose of the World_Weather_Analysis is to retrieve weather data and filter the data for the 
    user's weather preferences. Using the following information will allow us to identify potential 
    travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, user will 
    choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, 
    we will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
